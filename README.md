Training a Linear Regression model to predict Boston housing prices based off of a set of features.

Doing exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization on real-world housing data from Boston, MA.

### Steps ###

All work has been done in main.py.
1. import data from scikitlearn
2. format data into a DataFrame
3. perform various visualizations to gain insight
4. train a linear regression model and make Predictions
5. compare the predictions against the actual data with a scatter plot

### Visualizations ###
All Visualizations have been exported to the /plots/ directory
1. ActualVPredMEDV.png
  - Here is the scatterplot comparing the final results of the data
2. BostonHousingCorrHeatmap.png
  - A heatmap showing the correlation each feature has with the Median House value
3. BostonHousingDistPlot
  - a distribution plot using Seaborn of the Median House Value

This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University.

The Boston house-price data of Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. 'Hedonic
prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management,
vol.5, 81-102, 1978.   Used in Belsley, Kuh & Welsch, 'Regression diagnostics
...', Wiley, 1980.   N.B. Various transformations are used in the table on
pages 244-261 of the latter.

The Boston house-price data has been used in many machine learning papers that address regression
problems.
